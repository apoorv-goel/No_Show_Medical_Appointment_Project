# No_Show_Medical_Appointment_Project
A person makes a doctor appointment, receives all the instructions and it’s a no-show.

## Who/What to blame?

## What is a no-show?
Basically, it’s a non-attending person who neither uses nor cancels their reservation.

### The problem is…
People have no idea of the scale of this problem.
A recent survey concluded that as many as 42% of patients skip their appointments.
            
## “An appointment missed by you is an appointment missed by two.”

A missed appointment is more than just a missed opportunity. When a patient doesn’t show up on time, it also affects people who could’ve been treated instead of that patient.

Visitors, doctors, and even hospital administration…they’re all affected.

## Finding Reasons
### Different Surveys using different datasets came up with some influencing factors :
Financial Reasons

Discouraged by long Hospital wait time 

Poor Medical Literacy

Anxiety

Transportation
